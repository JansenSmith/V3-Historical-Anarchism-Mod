# V3-Historical-Anarchism-Mod
Goal is to create societal systems in Victoria 3 that reflect historical attempts to bring about Anarchistic styles of social arrangements.
Specifically, the works being conceptually drawn from wrt what "Anarchism" means are Pyotr Kropotkin & Emma Goldman, with implementation notes from the efforts of the anti-bolshevik Ukrainian general Nestor Makhno.
